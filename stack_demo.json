I'm not familiar with ADS, but I regularly use FireDAC with other databases. The database definition gives a default value to columns in newly created records where a value is not specified in the   statement.  So if the values are specified in the   statement then the default values will not apply, instead you will get the values supplied in the INSERT statement. If your application is not writing the default values then they will be assigned by the database.  However you will need to read the record to get the values.    implements a method   to refresh the current record which you could call in the   event handler. You can check what FireDAC is actually writing by use the built in monitoring.  Setup a monitoring component, and set the monitoring on your   to use it.  You will then be able to see what's actually being written to the database.  There is a monitoring application supplied with Delphi that will allow you to see the activity in real time in the monitoring application window. It's a little difficult to know what your application needs to be doing that it isn't doing from your description.  Without knowing how you are actually constructing your   statement (\"using FireDAC\" is not the answer here, are you using a   that you have populated yourself, or are you using something else to built it for you, for example  ) it's difficult to advise. However, if you create a record using an   statement through   then any columns that you don't set in the statement will have the default value from the column definition. This is how would expect the system to work, it may be that you are expecting something else as you are used to using different components. If what you are wanting to do is have the system read the record after you have written it then you will need to read the record. I do this myself in several systems, but I have always done it by issuing a   query myself. As pointed out above if you are using something that derives from   you can call   in the   event handler.

The structure for this is as follows: So I would suggest removing the   and creating a single grid for displaying all items. For the grid lines, one way to show the lines is to show them in the background behind the cells, using negative padding to extend into the spacing between the cells. Whether or not negative padding is added to the background and a divider line is shown depends on whether it is the first or last row, or first or last column. This requires knowing the number of rows, the overall number of items and the index of the item in the overall array. Here is the updated example to show it working this way. More notes follow below. If you want to prevent the pages from \"drifting\" as they are scrolled, the size of (cell width + spacing) needs to divide exactly into the screen width. For example, on an iPhone 16, the screen has a width of 393 points, so a cell width of 80.25 and spacing of 18 gives exact pages (as used above). The parameter   that is supplied to   is only used for horizontal spacing. To control the vertical spacing, add   as a parameter to the   too. The widths of the cells in your example are fixed, which works well for the gridlines. However, if the widths should be dynamic, such as if the cells contained just  , the grid lines would not be in the right places. A workaround might be to determine the size of the widest cell in a column using the technique shown in  . For the grid lines to work, it is also important that the cell content fits inside the cell. In your original example, you were setting a height of 80 on the content. This was overflowing the available height for the cells in the second row, because you have given the   for the second row a fixed height of 74. In the updated example above, the height of the cells is determined by the grid instead. When you were using a  , you also had visible page indicators. The indicators are missing from the solution above. A way to implement page indicators would be to add a state variable to track the  . If the width of the screen is known, the current page index can be derived from the current scroll position. The width of the screen can be found by attaching an   modifier to the  . Although not apparent from its name, this modifier also reports the initial size on first load. Page dots can then be shown as an overlay, like it is being done in   (it was my answer).
